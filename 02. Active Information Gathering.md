## DNS Enumeration
| DNS Record | Description |
|---|---|
| NS | Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.
| A | Also known as a host record, the “a record” contains the IPv4 address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
| AAAA | Also known as a quad A host record, the “aaaa record” contains the IPv6 address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
| MX | Mail Exchange records contain the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain. A domain can contain multiple MX records.
| PTR | Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and can find the records associated with an IP address.
| CNAME | Canonical Name Records are used to create aliases for other host records.
| TXT | Text records can contain any arbitrary data and be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.
