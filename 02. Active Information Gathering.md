## DNS Enumeration
| DNS Record | Description |
|---|---|
| NS | Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.
| A | Also known as a host record, the “a record” contains the IPv4 address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
| AAAA | Also known as a quad A host record, the “aaaa record” contains the IPv6 address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
| MX | Mail Exchange records contain the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain. A domain can contain multiple MX records.
| PTR | Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and can find the records associated with an IP address.
| CNAME | Canonical Name Records are used to create aliases for other host records.
| TXT | Text records can contain any arbitrary data and be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.
### Find the DNS Records with host
#### A
```bash
host www.google.com
```
#### MX
```bash
host -t MX google.com
```
#### txt
```bash
host -t txt google.com
```
#### Resolve Hostnames with List of Names
```bash
for ip in $(cat list.txt); do host $ip.google.com; done } grep -v "not found"
```
#### Scan IPs for Hostnames
```bash
for ip in $(seq 50 100); do host 11.22.33.$ip; done | grep -v "notfound"
```
#### NS Records
```bash
host -t ns <target>.com | cut -d " " -f 4
```
#### DNS Zone Transfer
```bash
host -l <target>.com ns1.<target>.com
```

## Host & Port Scanning
### NMAP
#### NMAP Default Scan
```bash
nmap <Target IP>
```
#### NMAP Stealth Scan
```bash
nmap -sS <Target IP>
```
#### NMAP Connect Scan
```bash
nmap -sT <Target IP>
```
#### NMAP UDP Scanning
```bash
nmap -sU <Target IP>
```
#### NMAP Stealth and UDP Scanning Combined
```bash
nmap -sS -sU <target IP>
```
#### NMAP Ping Sweep Scan
```bash
nmap -sn 10.10.10.10/24
```
#### NMAP Ping Sweep Scan - Alive Host File
```bash
nmap -v -sn 10.10.10.1024 -oG ping-sweep.txt
grep Up ping-sweep.txt | cut -d " " -f 2 >> Alive_Hosts.txt
cat Alive_Hosts.txt
```
#### NMAP Ideal set of scans
```bash
nmap -p- -sS -n -A -T4 -v 10.10.10.10 -oA Host_Scan --packet-trace --reason --disable-arp-ping
```
#### NMAP Firewall Bypass - ACK Scan
```bash
nmap -p- -sA -n -A -T4 -v 10.10.10.10 -oA Host_Scan --packet-trace --reason --disable-arp-ping
```
#### ##DNS Proxying
```
nmap -sS -p- -A 10.10.10.10 -oA ss_dns_host_scan --source-port 53
```

#### NMAP Port Sweep Scan - Host with Port Open
```bash
nmap -p 80 10.10.10.0/24 -oG web-sweep.txt
grep open web-sweep.txt | cut -d" " -f2 >> Alive-Web-Servers.txt
cat Alive-Web-Servers.txt
```

#### NMAP Top Port Scan 
```bash
nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 10.10.10.0/24 -oG top-port-sweep.txt
```

#### NMAP OS Scan
```bash
nmap -O 10.10.10.10 --osscan-guess
```

#### NMAP Connect Scan with OS and Service Enumeration - A
```bash
nmap -sV -sT -A 10.11.1.220
```
#### NMAP NSE Scripts


| Category | Description
|---|---|
| auth | Determination of authentication credentials.
| broadcast | Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.
| brute | Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.
| default | Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.
| discovery | Evaluation of accessible services.
| dos | These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.
| exploit | This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.
| external | Scripts that use external services for further processing.
| fuzzer | This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.
| intrusive | Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.
| malware | Checks if some malware infects the target system.
| safe | Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.
| version | Extension for service detection.
| vuln | Identification of specific vulnerabilities.
